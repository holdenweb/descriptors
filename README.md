# descriptors
A hands-on walk-through explanation of Python's descriptor protocol

This repository contains

  - A Jupyter notebook that you can execute to see the results emerge,
    and give RISE slide shows
  - An HTML file of the notebook showing the outputs,
    which you can read as a narrative

Please give feedback of all kinds by [raising issues](https://github.com/holdenweb/descriptors/issues/).
